    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>OrionHealth started with a simple idea: your health data belongs to you. In an age of cloud breaches and data mining, we wanted to build a safe haven for the most sensitive information you own.</p>

    <h2>The Team</h2>
    <p>We are a group of developers and privacy advocates passionate about decentralized technology and personalized medicine.</p>
